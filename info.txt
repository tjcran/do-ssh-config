This script is designed to generate an SSH config file based on your droplet hostname and IP address, using the DigitalOcean API v1.0.  It assumes that you are using the same port for each, as well as the same user name.  These values are to be added to a settings.py file as string variables, as well as the DO api key and client id. Once you've updated your config, run the script and it will ssh to each of your droplets and update all packages to the latest versions.  The ssh config file it generates is temporary and destroyed after the script runs. It does not remove your current file
